# TISCH2
[The updated Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH2)](http://tisch.comp-genomics.org/home/) is a scRNA-seq database, which focuses on tumor microenvironment (TME). TISCH provides detailed cell-type annotation for all curated datasets, enabling the exploration of TME across different cancer types.

## Release 1 - July 11th, 2020
## Release 2 - September 30th, 2022
### Data statistics
- **50 cancer types**.
- **190 datasets:** 40 datasets with ICB treatment (35 for human and 5 for mouse), 147 non-ICB datasets and 3 PBMC datasets.
- **6,297,320 cells:** 1,227,590 malignant cells and 5,069,730 non-malignant cells.

### New Functions & Features
##### Dataset Module
- **TF enrichment:** Find the potential transcription factors of each cluster in every dataset.
- **CCI analysis:** 1. A heatmap shows an overview of cell-cell interaction number between different cell clusters; 2. The detail interaction information for a selected cluster (circus plot); 3. The significant ligand-receptor pairs in of source and target clusters (bubble plot).
##### Gene Module
- **Survival:** Find the potential transcription factors of each cluster in every dataset.
- **Gene-gene correlation:** 1. A heatmap shows an overview of cell-cell interaction number between different cell clusters; 2. The detail interaction information for a selected cluster (circus plot); 3. The significant ligand-receptor pairs in of source and target clusters (bubble plot).
